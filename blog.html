              Hiiii! This is my first blog. This is about my favorite cartoon
              which is Rick and Morty. Never Watched ‘Rick and Morty’? This Is
              What You Need to Know: Whenever I am asked to explain the appeal
              of “Rick and Morty,” I propose a thought experiment. Imagine that
              you grew up with the world’s tragedies being beamed into your
              living room by 24-hour cable news. Your country has been at war
              for much your lifetime. You graduated college with a huge amount
              of debt, and you entered the work force during the recent
              financial crisis. Imagine, too, that the world’s ecological crisis
              weighs heavily on your mind and that you spend as much time on the
              internet as you do speaking to real human beings. If you were this
              sort of person, what television show would resonate with you?
              “Rick and Morty,” the Adult Swim animated comedy by Justin Roiland
              and Dan Harmon, just might be the answer. It is dark, even to the
              point of being nihilistic; it is absurdist; and it operates less
              like a novel or serial drama and more like a meme or internet
              video. It also speaks to the sense of alienation, anxiety and
              skepticism that it not uncommon among younger Americans today. And
              it has just been renewed for 70 episodes. Adult Swim announced
              last week that as a part of an overall deal with the series
              creators, “Rick and Morty,” which numbers 31 episodes in its first
              three seasons, will return for more than double that number. It’s
              a show about an ill-tempered, alcoholic scientific genius named
              Rick Sanchez and his teenage grandson, Morty Smith. At the
              beginning of the series, Rick reappears after a long absence. He
              struggles to reconnect with his daughter, Beth, but has more luck
              with her son, Morty, who joins him on adventures that take them
              all over the multiverse. Rick’s presence drives a wedge between
              Beth’s hapless husband Jerry — whom Rick loathes — and his family.
              That rift changes over the course of the series.
